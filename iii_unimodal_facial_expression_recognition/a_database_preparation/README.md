# III.A. Database Preparation

The Database Preparation described in this subsection results in _EmoHeVRDB-SFEA_ (see https://github.com/thorbenortmann/emoji-hero-vr-database).

We outsourced the preparation code into EmoHeVRDB's main repository
to have everything related to the database construction in one place:
